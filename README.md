# FieldTrip playground

This repository is for trying out various things.  _For example we can use it during the MEG/EEG toolkit._

At the moment it contains some code for the MATLAB continuous integration cloud service. See https://mathworks.github.io/ci-pilot/ for details.

We are also using it to test CODEOWNERS and issue templates.

We are also using it to test webhooks and actions.
