**Before you start**

1. Have you checked on both the [FieldTrip discussion list](http://fieldtriptoolbox.org/discussion_list)
   and the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/issues)
   to see if anybody else has lodged a similar observation.

2. How confident are you that the behaviour you have observed is in fact a
   genuine bug, and not a misunderstanding?

   -  *Confident*: Please [open a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/issues/new);
      select the "bug report" issue template to get started.

   -  *Not so confident*: That's fine! Consider instead creating a new topic
      on the [FieldTrip discussion list](http://fieldtriptoolbox.org/discussion_list);
      others can then comment on your observation and determine the
      appropriate level of escalation.
